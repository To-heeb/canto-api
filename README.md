# Canto Application API Documentation

Welcome to the API documentation for the Canto Application! This document provides information on how to interact with the APIs.


## Authentication

Before using the API endpoints, you must authenticate yourself. We use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication. To authenticate, include an `Authorization` header with a valid token in your request.

Example:

```

Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN

```
